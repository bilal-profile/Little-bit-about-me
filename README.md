Currently I am working as Data and Research Analyst (II) in Sacramento Unified School District. Here I lead and maintain data analysis projects, manage databases, process and publish visualized reports. 

My work involves in-depth SQL queries to obtain data from various data sources. I also run different ETLs (using Python) weekly or daily basis for data downloads. A significant amount of my work involves building and maintaining data visualization in Business Intelligence tool of Microsoft, Power BI. I also use Jaspersoft BI Studio to create visual reports and embed them in database for accessibility of the users. We maintain internal department reports on Tableau and that is another part of my job duties.

As a senior Data and Research Analyst, I coordinate projects with stakeholders, communicate across the departments and set project plans for the team.

In my previous roles spanning over 10 years, I worked in Operations/Supply Chain side of the business. Those roles were very team interactive, locally as well as globally. Supply Chain is a very customer demanding field where a constant line of communication along with the anticipation of customer requirements is the key. This experience has always helped me in participating in different scales of project as a stakeholder and as a PM.
